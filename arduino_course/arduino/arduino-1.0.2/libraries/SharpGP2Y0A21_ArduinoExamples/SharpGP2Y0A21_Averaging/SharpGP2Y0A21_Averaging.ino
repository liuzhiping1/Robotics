/*
 Sharp GP2Y0A21YK0F infrared proximity sensor (#28995)
 Collects an average of five readings from the sensor and displays the
 resulting value about every half second.
 
 See the SharpGP2Y0A21_Simple demonstration for additional usage notes,
 including connection diagram.
 
 This example code is for the Arduino Uno and direct compatible boards, using the
 Arduino 1.0 or later IDE software. It has not been tested, nor designed for, other 
 Arduino boards, including the Arduino Due.
